# 🎯 Random Number Guesser

A simple command-line Python game where users guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user enters the **start** and **end** values to define a number range.
2. The program validates both inputs to ensure they are numbers and that the end is greater than the start.
3. A random number is generated within the specified range.
4. The user repeatedly guesses until they get the correct number.
5. The program displays the number of attempts taken.
